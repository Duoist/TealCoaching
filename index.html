        <p class="hover:text text-center text-xl">
          I am a silicon valley veteran. On my path to seek technical excellence
          I discovered something far more powerful - the excellence within each
          of us. That ability we inherit to solve and to achieve is so powerful
          it fascinates me. Let me work with you to unleash that excellence in
          you.

          Being a San Jose Sharks' fan gives half of the reason for the name
          Teal Coaching ðŸ˜€. Teal is also the combination of green and blue.
          Green is the color of spring, signaling growth, creativity, and
          energy. Blue is the color of the sky and the ocean, representing
          limitless potential, imagination, and governance. By combining the two
          together I find the harmony and meaning behind coaching.
